            <p class="first-paragraph">Richard McIntyre, OAM, BMus (University of Sydney) has maintained a long and distinguished career
                as bassoonist, music educator, conductor and arranger. A Composition graduate from Sydney University, he was
                appointed Associate Principal Bassoon with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as a 20-year-old in 1968, moving to
                The Canberra School of Music as a foundation member of the Canberra Wind Soloists in 1978. With this renowned
                quintet, he recorded and toured internationally during a 30-year period, and gave it a unique repertoire with
                his virtuoso arrangements of large-scale orchestral works. He was for many years Principal Bassoon with the
                Australian Chamber Orchestra, and appeared on many occasions as guest Principal Bassoon with most of the
                Symphony Australia Orchestras – also as concerto soloist, and independently as a recitalist.</p>

            <p>His continuing work as Principal Bassoon with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra dates back to
                student days of 1965 – 67. If you’d like to hear some of his work as bassoonist, chamber musician, and arranger,
                you’ll find it on YouTube under Canberra Wind Soloists.</p>

            <p>Simultaneously, he has sustained a career as one of Australia’s most respected bassoon teachers,
                at all levels from beginner to post-graduate and professional. In addition he has worked tirelessly in the
                development of orchestral and ensemble skills with students of all instruments, particularly at the advanced
                tertiary level. He was for many years a regular tutor and conductor at the Australian Youth Orchestra’s National
                Music Camps. He has taught over many years in south-east Asia.</p>

            <p>His work as a conductor is well-known, particularly in Canberra. He was Conductor and Musical
                Director of the Canberra Youth Orchestra from 1980 – 1990, greatly broadening its repertoire and general
                endeavour, and led it on three highly-successful and widely-acclaimed European tours. His Canberra contribution
                has included development of and much work with the School of Music Orchestra, Canberra Opera, Canberra
                Philharmonic Society, thirteen-years as Musical Director of The Llewellyn Choir (with development of its
                accompanying professional ensemble, The Canberra Chamber Orchestra), and three years as Musical Director of The
                Oriana Chorale.</p>

            <p>His numerous conducting activities outside of Canberra have included the foundation and
                development of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, with which he continues his association as Artistic Advisor and
                frequent conductor.</p>

            <p>His 35-year career at the Canberra (now ANU) School of Music played a significant part in the
                creation of its erstwhile international reputation. Awards have included 1986 Canberran of the Year, Advance
                Australia, Sounds Australian, and National Critics’ Circle awards. In 1992 he was granted an Order of Australia
                Medal, for services to Music and Music Education, particularly for his work with the Canberra Youth Orchestra.
                In 2013, he was elected President of the Australian Double Reed Society.</p>
