            <p>
                The Townsville Barrier Reef Orchestra was has been around since the year 2000.
                In the years before it’s formation, many Townsville art and music lovers sought
                to introduce a community based orchestra into their city’s culture.
                When the new millennium came around, so too did the opportunity they’d waited for.<br>
            </p>
            <p hidden id="AUM">
                To test the viability of this new orchestra,
                a weekend workshop began that was run by the senior lecturer
                of the Canberra School of Music – Richard McIntyre. Many aspiring musicians
                were invited to these meetings,
                and thus the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born.<br><br>

                Since then, the orchestra has performed many times with various guest
                conductors directing the show under the patronage of the North Queensland
                Ensembles Inc. While typically the orchestra as a whole only performs 3 major concerts
                per year, smaller groups of orchestra members regularly perform throughout the year in
                shows such as Orpheus Strings, Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio and many more.

            <h1 class="space" id="OR">Orchestra Composition</h1>
            <p>
                Music is the culmination of a variety of sounds combined in
                such a way that inspires feelings in the listener. Orchestras use this
                to a greater degree, which allows for more nuances in the sound created.<br>
            </p>
            <div hidden id="OCM">
                <p>
                    With so many different tones and pitches, it can be difficult to identify
                    which instrument is responsible for what. So, for those looking to find
                    out more, below is a compilation of an orchestra’s many families of sound
                    and the instruments that belong to them.
                </p>

                <div class="instruments">
                    <p>
                        <img class="image-box" src="images/instruments/string/violin.png">
                        String – String instruments produce theirs sounds by vibrating the strings.
                        By changing the thickness, length, and tension of the string, the sound
                        created can be modified. Strings that are tight or thin create a higher
                        pitched sound compared to strings that are loose or thick. Some string
                        instruments also have companion tools that utilize their own strings in
                        harmony with the main instrument.
                    </p>

                        <img class="image-box" src="images/instruments/brass/french-horn.png">
                        Brass – Brass instruments are the tubed shaped instruments that players
                        use with their lips. Instruments with larger mouth piece openings produce
                        lower base sounds than those with small mouth pieces. The main method of
                        altering a brass instruments sound is by opening or closing tubes of various
                        length via valves. As tubes of different length create different sounds, the
                        sounds each of these tubes make will be different to each adding, allowing
                        for some variance in sound.<br>

                        <img class="image-box" src="images/instruments/percussion/cymbal.png">
                        Percussion – Percussion instruments have perhaps the most simple classification
                        of instrument families. If an instrument is struck to make it’s sound, it is a
                        percussion instrument. Due to the similarities between some percussion instruments,
                        many musicians learn to use multiple kinds of percussion instruments as they can
                        easily translate their initial skills. Sounds created are influenced by how hard
                        the instrument is struck, as well as other factors such as such as the location hit,
                        and in the case of drums, how tight the head of barrel-like percussion instruments are.<br>

                        <img class="image-box" src="images/instruments/woodwind/piccolo.png">
                        Woodwind – Woodwind instruments are similar to Brass instruments in that they involve
                        the users mouth. However, Woodwind instruments focus less on the actual instruments
                        structure and more on the path the air blown in must travel. Woodwind musicians are
                        constantly covering and uncovering multiple holes adorning their instruments, which
                        alters the pitch and tone of the sound produced. While not anymore, Woodwind instruments
                        used to all be made from wood. This musical family has nonetheless kept the title
                        despite most modern Woodwind instruments being made from a combination of plastic,
                        wood or metal.

            <p>
                The Barrier Reef Orchestra is a community driven organisation. Our dedicated
                members volunteer their time and talent to practice each performance for you to see.
                We each believe in doing our part to keep this amazing part of our culture blooming,
                as music is one of the universal languages we share as people.
            </p>
            <p hidden id="CBM">
                It allows us to share and understand feelings in a way that words cannot do alone.
                It is our goal to inspire as many music lovers as we can to pursue their ambitions
                in this diverse cultural legacy whether they be young or old.<br><br>

                To that end, the Barrier Reef Orchestra is always willing to assist aspiring musicians.
                Solo artists can have difficulties in the beginning phases of their careers, as they
                lack the recognition needed to secure a stable position. We assist in this by allowing
                Solo artists to perform as guests in our performances. These performances allow the
                artists to showcase their skills, making a mark in this cultural field. Our performances
                only guests are not these aspiring artists, however. On occasion, we are also joined by
                famous conductors such as Richard McIntyre and Mario Dobernig.
